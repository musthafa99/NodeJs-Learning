Reading and Writing Files
	Reading and Writing the file in node.js can be done using one of the module called "fs module". A file can  be wriiten in both synchronous and Asynchronous ways.

Synchronous Method:
	This method is code blocking method which means given method will excute the code until its excution is finished.
Syntax:
Read:
	fs.readFileSync(filename,character enconding)
here,character enconding is generally utf-8
Write:
	fs.writeFileSync(filename,content)
Asynchronous Method:
	It has a callback Function that is excutes on completion of excution of given method and thus allows to run durni the completion of its excution.
Syntax:
Read:
	fs.readFile(filename,character enconding,Callback fucntion(err,data))
Write:
	fs.writeFile(filename,content,function err)
	
Delete a File
	fs.unlink(filename) -used to delete a file.

Creating and Removing Directories
Synchronus way:
	fs.mkdirSync(nameofDirectorty)- it will create directory.
	fs.rmdirSync(nameofDirectorty)- it will delete directory.


Asynchrnous way:
	fs.mkdir(nameofDirectorty,call back Function)-it will create directory.

to delete a directory first we need to unlink a file.
