Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre
of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels)
the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed
once they have legally done so six times.
